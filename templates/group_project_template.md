Hotel chain effect
=============

# OVERVIEW
Bad weather reduces travel, which then reduces overnight lodging. That’s not good news if you’re in the hotel business. However, Red Roof Inn turned this trend on its head. The hotel chain recognized that cancelled flights leave travelers in a bind and in need of a place to sleep overnight. The company sourced freely available weather and flight cancellation information, organized by combinations of hotel and airport locations, and built an algorithm which factored weather severity, travel conditions, time of the day and cancellation rates by airport and airline among other variables. With its big data insights, and recognition that travelers will be using mobile devices for this use case, the company used Search, PPC and SoLoMo mobile campaigns to deliver targeted mobile ads to stranded travelers and make it easy for them to book a nearby hotel.

This big data payback is compelling. Flight cancellations average 1-3% daily, which translates into 150 to 500 cancelled flights or around 25,000 to 90,000 stranded passengers each day. With its big data and geo-based mobile marketing campaigns Red Roof Inn achieved a 10% business increase from 2013 to 2014.



# DATA
Hotel chain data can be available in the link http://www.tophotelprojects.com/en/our-products/tophotelchains-global-classic


# RESEARCH QUESTIONS
How do the business travellers choose hotels? .
Why the Brand? 
Why the “mid-scale” hotels?
Why qualitative?


# MODELS AND ANALYSIS

What models did you use to process your data and perform the analysis of your research questions?  
Information Transfer Model

Describe your methods and how you applied your models to the data.  
The methods we are going to implement in the data by collecting information that aquired from the clients and on the basis of percentage of the customer answer we achieve the goals.

# CODE AND APPLICATION

For your application you will be writing code.  Please make sure your group:

- provides the Github link to your code,
- provides detailed instructions on how to compile and deploy your code,
- provides any special instructions for running your code and/or applying data to see the results.

The code needs to be Github and instructions on installation are in the README.md file at the root level.

# PROJECT MANAGEMENT

You will need to provide details on:

- the team members,
- the roles of each member,
- the skills and contributions of each member.

You will also provide details about the project deliverables and milestones.  These example tables should be used as a guide.

# PROJECT TEAM, DELIVERABLES AND CHECKPOINTS
These tables show  examples of the data that should go into each column and row.


## TEAM

| Team member | Roles and skills | Contributions |
|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|

## DELIVERABLES AND CHECKPOINTS

The deliverable and checkpoints will be iteratively completed.  At the end of the project, there should be a fair amount of content these tables that details the who, what and when of your project.  Don't worry if you don't have all the deliverables sketched out -- this is a LIVING table, and should be updated frequently by all team members involved in the project.

| Checkpoint date | Expected Deliverable                                                          | Responsible team member(s) | Checkpoint results                                                                                                                  |
